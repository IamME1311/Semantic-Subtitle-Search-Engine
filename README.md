# Semantic-Subtitle-Search-Engine

Project partner : Hannah Igboke, LINK to her profile : https://github.com/HannahIgboke
In this project we built an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that bridges the gap between a userâ€™s search intent and the content of video subtitles. We did this by utilizing techniques like light cleaning to preserve contextual meanings, semantic chunking on our subtitle files to mitigate information loss and created an iterative web app to test our solution. This is a glimpse of what can be done in building a semantic based search engine for video subtitles. We encourage exploring this concept deeper in building a more robust search engine.
